# Sparse-Merkle-Signature-Scheme
Merkle Signature Scheme with alternative traversal algorithm providing efficient space-time tradeoffs

## Note
This is my Master-Thesis I did at the FHNW in Switzerland. 
It contains my an implementation of the merkle traversal algortithm deschribed in [Master_Thesis_Markus_Knecht.pdf](Master_Thesis_Markus_Knecht.pdf)
The repository also contains implementation of other traversal schemes including Merkle Signature Schemes using these schemes and benchmark tests as well as results (on my machine) of them intended to compare the different traversal algorithms.
